Bugger
===============================
The goal of Bugger is to collect keys. Get as many keys as you can and then jump into the river. The more Keys you possess, the more bugs will roam across the street.
There is no win condition. This game is meant to test your dexterity. Do you have what it takes to cross the buggers!
